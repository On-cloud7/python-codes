# most asked question:

# 1.print the while loop output in same line:

# print("hello", end = " ")
# print("madhav")

# i = 1
# while i < 4:
#     print(f"Hello Madhav {i}",end = " ")
#     i +=1

# 2 print star patterns - using loops:

# Simple Triangle:
n= 5

for i in range(1,n+1):
    for j in range(1,i+1):
        print("*",end = " ")
    print()
